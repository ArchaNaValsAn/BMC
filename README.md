- Cinelogues – iOS Movie App
- Cinelogues is a movie listing app built using **UIKit**, **Core Data**, and **TMDb API**, following the **MVVM** architecture. It allows users to browse popular, now-playing, and upcoming movies, search for movies, and manage their list of favorites offline.

## Features
- Browse movies
- Search movies by title
- Add or remove movies from favorites
- Persistent offline storage using Core Data
- MVVM architecture
- Unit & UI tests included

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15 or later  
- iOS 15.0+ target  
- Swift 5.0+  
- A TMDb API Key

 ### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArchaNaValsAn/BMC.git
   cd cinelogues

##Note
⚠️ TMDb access may not work without a VPN in certain regions.
If you’re unable to see movie data loading (like the carousel or movie list), please connect to a VPN and try again.

This is a known limitation due to regional API restrictions, not an issue with the app itself.
